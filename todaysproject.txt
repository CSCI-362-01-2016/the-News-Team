The Amara platform creates specialized subtitles for Youtube videos.  Amara was written in Python, and contains a database online of videos which its API can access.  For database calls to get and post videos, Amara uses JSON commands.

The Amara github repository was made with Docker, a platform that contains software.  This platform packages the Amara application into a standard unit for software developing.  Docker required many steps to be completed such as downloading their software and setting up the docker daemon to run in the background.  Naturally, our team had difficulty downloading the project.  Since Amara was to be run on Linux, each of us used a virtual computer.  However, after a lot of frustration, we realized that the Amara project would not build because its file size was greater than the default disk space given by VirtualBox.  The solution was to manually increase the size of the virtual machine’s VDI file (virtual disk image), and then download an ISO (image of a CD or DVD) in order to match the upgraded partition with the virtual disk image’s new size. 
After installing docker daemon and cloning amara's repo the project would still not build. The readout was saying that docker daemon wasn't installed even though verified that it had been. However, calling sudo bin/dev build vs bin/dev build built the project.
Now that the virtual machine had sufficient space, we re-downloaded Docker and successfully built the Amara project, started its containers, and configured the database, allowing us to set up a temporary server and run the project's test cases.
